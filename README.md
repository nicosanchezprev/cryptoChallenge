# CryptocurrenciesChallenge
CryptocurrenciesChallenge with React Native in DevLabs.

## How to Start the project 
  
  First of all, clone this repository.
  
### Make sure you have the next technologies!
  Install Node.js and npm, which are required for React Native development.

#### Android
* Make sure you have a device from android connected to the PC via USB, otherwise you must have installed a virtual device, and the SDK in Android Studio.

#### IOS
* Install Xcode, which is the development environment for macOS.

* In Xcode, install the iOS Simulator, which will allow you to test your app on different devices.

* Open up a terminal window and run the following command: npm install -g react-native-cli. This will install the React Native command line interface (CLI).


## After you set up everything run:

*npx react-native run-android || npx react-native run-ios*
